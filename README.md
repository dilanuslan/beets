Hello world,

This is my project for graduating from Istanbul Technical University Computer Engineering department.

We're dealing with such crazy times nowadays and hopefully we will leave these days behind with the least damage. I have clearly seen that life is all about the things that happen while we do plans. 

I was so insecure about programming throughout my college years but thanks to this project and quarantine, I made a huge progress and I'm proud of myself. It is an honour for me to announce that I came to the end of development process of this plugin. I will add test cases and comment lines to files. 

Hopefully, one month from today I will be able to call myself a computer engineer. I'm looking forward to dedicating myself and respecting to my job. 

Please do something everyday to make your future-self proud and thankful.

#StayHome #StaySafe 

Peace.
