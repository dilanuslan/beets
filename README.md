Hello world,

This is my project for graduating from Istanbul Technical University Computer Engineering department.

We're dealing with such crazy times nowadays and hopefully we will leave these days behind with the least damage.

I have clearly seen that life is all about the things that happen while we do plans. So I need to take responsibility for my mistakes. The most important thing is to be grateful for each and every day of our lives. This quarantine process made me a totally new person. I'm not going to take this project and my school for granted. 

Hopefully, this time everything will work just fine and I will end up with a happy ending. 

Please do something everyday to make your future-self proud and thankful.

#StayHome #StaySafe 

Peace.
