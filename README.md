Hello world,

This is my project for graduating from Istanbul Technical University Computer Engineering department.

We're dealing with such crazy times nowadays and hopefully we will leave these days behind with the least damage.

I got out of my quarantine which lasted for 14 days and finally have the internet connection. There is no better way to spend these times dealing with the code, taking responsibility and taking the project to the next level.

I hope that in 6 months from today, I will read back this little note with a smile on my face and a joy in my heart.

#StayHome #StaySafe 

Peace.
